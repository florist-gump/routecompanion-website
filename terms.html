        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App offers a one-time "Pro Mode" purchase that unlocks additional features including route export, smart notifications, and Live Activity. All purchases are processed through Apple's App Store or Google Play and are subject to their respective terms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pro Mode is a one-time, non-consumable purchase.</li>

            <li>You can restore your purchase on any device signed into the same Apple ID or Google account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree to use the App only for its intended purpose: planning and navigating outdoor routes. You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.</li>
            <li>Use the App in any way that could damage, disable, or impair the service.</li>
            <li>Abuse or overload the third-party APIs the App relies on (OpenStreetMap, weather services, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App integrates with third-party services including OpenStreetMap, Strava, Komoot, Ride with GPS, and weather data providers. Your use of these integrations is also subject to their respective terms of service. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content provided by third-party services.</p>

        <h2>6. Route and Navigation Data</h2>
        <p>Route Companion provides automatically generated route lines and Point of Interest (POI) data for informational purposes only, provided on an "as is" basis. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or real-time availability of routes, trails, or locations. Users are strictly responsible for following local traffic laws, trail signs, and assessing their own safety in real-world conditions. You assume all risks associated with your planning and navigation. Route Companion assumes no liability for any injury, damage, or loss.</p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, personal injury, or property damage arising from your use of the App. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App or any in-app purchase.</p>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content, design, code, and trademarks associated with Route Companion are owned by us or our licensors. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or third parties.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Germany.</p>
